    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I am a quick-learning digital marketer with a focus in client management. I am passionate about creating top-notch strategies and function best in collaborative teams. I am motivated by the fun of solving clients' business problems with my digital marketing tools and my strong communication skills. I have executed and led projects spanning organic search, paid search, social, and content marketing and worked for clients across industries such as Progressive Insurance, Georgia Pacific, Amway, Ameriprise Financial, and American Eagle Outfitters. When not consulting with clients, I love hosting elaborate dinner parties, thinking too much about television, watching the latest Bollywood romcoms, and plotting ways to run into Ira Glass for an afternoon of poignant storytelling.
